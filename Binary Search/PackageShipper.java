/**

 * Approach:
 * - Binary Search on answer space [max(weights), sum(weights)]
 * - Greedily check if we can ship within 'days' using current capacity
 * - If yes, try smaller capacity; else increase capacity
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(N Ã— log(S - M)), where
 *   - N is number of weights
 *   - S is sum of weights (right bound)
 *   - M is max weight (left bound)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
