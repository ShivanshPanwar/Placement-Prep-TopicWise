/**
 * Problem: Length of Last Word
 * Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-last-word/
 *
 * âœ… Approach:
 * - Use two pointers (`right` and `left`) to scan the string from the end.
 * - Step 1: Skip all trailing spaces or non-letter characters.
 * - Step 2: Identify the last word by moving the left pointer until a non-letter is found.
 * - Step 3: Return the length as (right - left).
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1)
