 * ðŸ“Œ Problem:
 * Given three strings s1, s2, and s3, determine the minimum number of character deletions
 * needed (from the end of strings) to make their prefixes equal. If they don't start
 * with the same character, return -1.
 *
 * âœ… Approach:
 * - First, check if all three strings start with the same character. If not, return -1.
 * - Then, iterate through the strings simultaneously to find the longest common prefix.
 * - For each character match, subtract 3 from the total length (1 from each string).
 * - Return the remaining length as the total number of deletions required.
 *
 * ðŸ’¡ Time Complexity: O(n), where n = min(length of s1, s2, s3)
 * ðŸ’¡ Space Complexity: O(1)
